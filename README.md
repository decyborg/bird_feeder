## Bird feeder classifier

This is a toy example of a classifier that could be used in a bird feeder to detect
whether the animal on it is a blue jay, northern cardinal, chickadee or a squirrel!

It was done by following along the fast.ai course and using their bear classifier
example using fastai and voila.
